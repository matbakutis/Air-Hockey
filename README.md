# Air-Hockey
An air hockey game bulit for IOS, but mainly for an IPad. Built using Unity and C# scripts.

This was my first attempt at a game without following a tutorial. While it took many bulids to finally be playable, I am very satisfied with how it turned out in my given time constraints.

There are many things that are still missing in order to make this a complete game worth downloading, but I don't think I will continue adding to this project. The reason behind this decision is that I have a couple different ideas for games I would like to rather spend my time on.
